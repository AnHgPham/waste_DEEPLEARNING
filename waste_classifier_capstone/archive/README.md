# Archive - Legacy Course Structure

This directory contains the original week-based course structure for reference purposes.

## ⚠️ Status: ARCHIVED

**These folders are NO LONGER USED in the main workflow.**

All functionality has been moved to the new production structure:
- `Week*/utils/` → `src/`
- Scripts → `scripts/`
- Notebooks → `notebooks/`
- Documentation → `docs/`
